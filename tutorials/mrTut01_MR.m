%% Magnetic Resonance Principles
% This tutorial explains basic principles of magnetic resonance signals. As 
% the first tutorial in the series, it also gives you an opportunity to examine 
% basic Matlab commands. In this tutorial, principles are illustrated for signals 
% derived from a bulk substance, such as a beaker of water. Various terms used 
% to describe the MR principles are introduced
% 
%    *spins, parallel and anti-parallel, Boltzman distribution*
% 
% Also, tissue properties such as *T1* (longitudinal) and *T2*(spin-spin) 
% interactions, are explained and the way in which signal contrast depends on 
% these parameters is explained. 
% 
% The next tutorial, MRImaging, takes up the topic of how to make images 
% that measure these tissue properties in a non-uniform volume, such as a head.

%% Spins resonance frequency
% When a substance with net spin is placed in a steady magnetic field, it precesses 
% at a frequency that is characteristic of that substance. We can compute the 
% precession frequency from the following simple formula. Note the units. (see 
% chapter 3 and ca. p. 51i, 60ii for a discussion of precession).
%%
B0 = 1.5;     % Magnetic field strength (Tesla)
g = 42.58e+6; % Gyromagnetic constant for hydrogen (Hz / Tesla)
v = g*B0      % The resonant (Larmor) frequency of hydrogen
%% *Question 1*
% What are the units of the Larmor frequency, v, for hydrogen as expressed  
% above? The gyromagnetic constant of sodium is 11.27e+6 Hz/Tesla.  Compute the 
% Larmor frequency of sodium in a 3T magnet.
v_sodium = 11.27*10^6*3

% Ordinarily, the Larmor frequency (resonant frequency) is expressed 
% in MegaHertz (millions of hertz) 
fprintf('Hydrogen Larmor frequency\n %0.4f MHz at %.1f Tesla \n',...
    v/(10^6),B0);
%% Spin Energy
% The energy in a precessing spin is proportional to its resonant frequency, 
% v. The constant of proportionality between energy and frequency is a famous 
% constant called *Planck's constant. *(Extra credit: Find out something interesting 
% about Max Planck). Hence, the amount of energy in a hydrogen molecular in this 
% magnetic field is
%%
h = 6.626e-34; % Planck's constant (J s)
E = h*v;
%% *Question 2*
% What are the units of E?
% Hz*J
% 
% At steady state, say when the subject enters the magnet and prior to any 
% measurements, the dipoles align parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field. 
% (The textbook illustrates this with a nice metaphor of gravity in Figure 3.7ii, 
% 3,6i.) 
% 
% The energy difference between these two states is proportional to the mean 
% magnetic field.  This is called the Zeeman effect (see Figure 3.8i,  3.9ii in 
% the book). 
% 
% The proportion of dipoles aligned parallel (low energy) and anti-parallel 
% (high energy) to the main field is described by the Boltzmann distribution. 
% The formula that determines the fraction of dipoles in the low and high energy 
% states is in Hornak (Chapter 2).
%%
k = 1.3805e-23;      % Boltzmann's constant, J/Kelvin
T = 300;             % Degrees Kelvin at room temperature
dE = h * g * B0;      % Transition energy
ratioHigh2Low = exp(-dE/(k*T));  % Boltzmann's formula, Hornak, Chapter 3; Huettel, p. 76ii

% Under typical conditions the number of dipoles in the low and high energy
% states are very similar.
fprintf('Ratio of high/low energy state dipoles:  %e \n',ratioHigh2Low)
%% 
% At low temperatures (near absolute zero), very few of the dipoles enter 
% the high (anti-parallel) energy state.  No, this is not important for us. But 
% I find the numbers interesting and can see why people might want to work on 
% low temperature physics for a while.

% * Where is human body temperature on the graph?  
% 20 celsius = 20+273.15 = 293.15 K

%% T1 tissue contrast
% The tendency of dipoles to align (either parallel or anti-parallel) with the 
% B0 magnetic field imposes an opportunity to probe tissue properties using magnetic 
% resonance. MR signals are derived by perturbing the ordered spins (excitation) 
% and then measuring the emissions (reception) as the dipoles return to their 
% low energy state. The way the dipoles return to their low energy state provides 
% information about the local tissue.
% 
% Summing the effect of the many many dipoles within a voxel, we obtain a 
% measure of the dipoles within the voxel called the net magnetization. This is 
% represented by a single vector (see the many examples in Hornak). Most reasoning 
% about the MR signal is based on understanding models of the net magnetization 
% vector and how it recovers after being perturbed by the radio frequency pulses 
% in the presence of changing magnetic fields. 
%% Net magnetization
% The MR measurements that we obtain describe the *net magnetization* in the 
% direction perpendicular to the main axis (B0 field). This direction is illustrated 
% in the following figures.
% 
% First, here is a 3D plot that shows the net magnetization as a red circle 
% in the steady-state.  The blue lines show the three axes.

% After receiving an excitation pulse, this component of the MR signal decays 
% gradually over time.  The spin-lattice decay has been measured and, in general, 
% it follows an exponential decay rate.
% 
% Specifically, here is the rate of recovery of the T1 magnetization for 
% hydrogen molecules in gray matter.
%%
T1 = 0.88;          % Time constant units of S
t = (0.02:0.02:6);  % Time in seconds
Mo = 1;             % Set the net magnetization in the steady state to 1 and ignore.

% This is the exponential rate of recovery of the T1 magnetization, after
% it has been set to zero by flipping the net magnetization 90 degrees.

%% 
% The decay rates for various brain tissues (summarized by the parameter 
% T1 above) differs both with the material and with the level of the B0 field.The 
% value T1 = 0.88 seconds above is typical of gray matter at 1.5T.
% 
% The T1 value for white matter is slightly smaller.  Comparing the two we 
% see that white matter recovers slightly faster (has a smaller T1):

%% 
% Notice that the time to recover all the way back to Mo is fairly long, 
% on the order of 3-4 sec.  This is a limitation in the speed of acquisition for 
% T1 imaging.
% 
% The difference in the T1 component of the signal from gray matter and white 
% matter changes over time. This difference is plotted in the next graph.
%%
plot(t,abs(MzW - MzG));
xlabel('Time (s)'); ylabel('Magnetization difference'); grid on
%% Question 4
% If you are seeking to make a measurement that optimizes the signal to noise 
% ratio between these two materials, at what time would you measure the recovery 
% of the T1 signal? 
t([(MzW - MzG) == max(MzW - MzG)])

%% Question 5
% Look up the T1 value of cerebro-spinal fluid: (CSF).  Plot the T1 recovery 
% of CSF.  At what time you would measure to maximize the white/CSF contrast.
T1_csf = 4;
Mz_csf = Mo *( 1 - exp(-t ./ T1_csf) );
%plot(t,Mz_csf,'b-',t,MzW,'r--');
plot(t,abs(MzW - MzG));

% 
% We can visualize this difference as follows. Suppose that we have two beakers, 
% adjacent to one another, containing materials with different T1 values.  Suppose 
% we make a pair of images in which the intensity of each image is set to the 
% T1 value over time. What would the T1 images look like? 
%%
% The beakers start with the same, Mo, magnetization.
beaker1 = Mo*ones(32,32);
beaker2 = Mo*ones(32,32);

% They will have different T1 relaxation values
T1(1) = 0.64;       % T1 for white matter
T1(2) = 0.88;       % T1 for gray matter
movieT = (0.001:.1:4);   % We sample the movie at these times (in sec)
%% 
% Here is a movie, slowed down, showing the relative intensities of the 
% images over a 4 sec period, measured every 100 ms.   The frames are shown at 
% 1/4 the real speed (i.e., every 100 ms). As you can see, if we make a picture 
% of the net magnetization around 0.6-1.0 sec during the decay, there will be 
% a good contrast difference between the gray and white matter.  Measured earlier 
% or later, the picture will have less contrast.

%% T2 contrast
% There is a second physical mechanism, in addition to the spin-lattice measurement, 
% that influences the MR signal. This second mechanism is called spin-spin interaction 
% (transverse relaxation). This signaling mechanism is particularly important 
% for functional magnetic resonance imaging and the BOLD signal.
% 
% In describing the T1 signal, we treated the MR signal as a single unified 
% vector. In the example above, we explored what happens to the net magnetization 
% of the MR signal when the vector is rotated 90 deg into the x-y plane.
% 
% But we omitted any discussion the fact that the dipoles are assumed to 
% be continuously precessing around the main axis together, in unison. Perhaps 
% in a perfectly homogeneous environment, these rotating dipoles would precess 
% at the Larmor frequency in perfect synchronization and we could treat the single 
% large vector as we have.
% 
% But in practice, the dipoles within a single voxel of a functional image 
% each experience slightly different magnetic field environments. Consequently, 
% they each have their own individual Larmor frequencies, proportional to the 
% magnetic field that they experience. An important second mechanism of MR is 
% a consequence of the fact that the individual dipoles each have their own local 
% magnetic field and the synchrony soon dissipate.
% 
% Suppose  we have a large sample of dipoles that are spinning together in 
% perfect phase.  We can specify their orientation as an angle in this plane, 
% theta.  Let's assume they all share a common angle
%%
nSamples = 10000;
theta = zeros(nSamples,1);

% Then the position of the spins in the (x,y) plane will be
spins = [cos(theta), sin(theta)];

% And they will all fall at the same poisiton
