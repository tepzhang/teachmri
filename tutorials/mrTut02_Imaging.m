% This tutorial covers two related topics.  First, pulse sequence methods 
% for measuring T1 or T2 are illustrated.  These are introduced by explaining 
% two types of pulse sequences (inversion recovery and spin echo) that selectively 
% emphasize the T1 or T2 tissue properties.
% 
% Then, the tutorial continues with a very simple example of how one can 
% form images of the relaxation constants (T1 or T2) at different positions 
% 
% To further explore k-space sampling issues, run kspaceDemo 
%% T1 signals (Used for anatomical images)
% Inversion-Recovery (IR)
% 
% Inversion-Recovery pulse sequences are a method for measuring T1 relaxation 
% (spin-lattice). As the sequence name suggests, the pulse sequence first inverts 
% the net magnetization (180 deg pulse). Then, the sequences simply pauses for 
% a time, TI, to let the longitudinal magnetization recover towards steady state 
% across the tissue. Then, a 90deg pulse is delivered that places the net magnetization 
% in the transverse plane. The transverse magnetization is measured right away, 
% before significant dephasing, in order to estimate the T1 properties.
%%
% To help you visualize the events, run this code a few times.  The first
% plot shows the 180-TI-90 sequence for a relatively slow T1 value.

% Now, suppose the tissue has a faster T1 relaxation
subplot(1,2,2); cla
title('Fast T1 relaxation')
T1 =0.6;
inversionRecovery(T1);
%% Question 1
% If we apply a 90-degree pulse at the time when exactly half the signal has 
% recovered, what do you expect the transverse magnetization to be?
% 0
% (Extra credit: is this the same as applying a pulse at T1? Why or why not?)
% 
% Comparing the two panels, you can see that the amplitude of the net transverse 
% magnetization depends on the value of T1. The final 90 deg flip let us measure 
% the size of the longitudinal magnetization. Because the measurement takes place 
% immediately after this flip, there is not much time for spin-spin dephasing 
% and we measure mainly properties of T1.  That is why such sequences are called 
% 'T1-weighted'.
%% T2 images
% *Spin Echo (Hahn)*
% 
% In principle, to make a T2 measurement we need only to flip the net magnetization 
% 90 deg and then measure the signal decay as the spins dephase. Because the T2 
% reduction is very fast compared to the T1 reduction, so the decay we be nearly 
% all due to T2.
% 
% The spin-spin dephasing occurs so quickly that it is almost impossible 
% to obtain a T2 measurement soon enough after the 90 deg flip. The *Hahn Spin 
% Echo*, and another method called the *Gradient Echo*, make it possible to separate 
% the time between the RF pulse and the measurement.
% 
% The next visualization shows two spins within a single voxel. These spins 
% are experiencing slightly differeent local magnetic fields. Consequently, one 
% precesses around the origin slightly faster than the other. After a little time 
% the signals are well out of phase. Then, a 180 deg inverting pulse is introduced. 
% This pulse rotates the spins around the horizontal axis (x-axis). Seen within 
% the plane, this causes the two spins to reverse positions so that the leader 
% becomes the follower. The leader is still in a higher local field, and so after 
% a while it catches up. At this moment the spin phasese come together to create 
% an echo of the signal after the first 90 deg pulse. This echo happens at a point 
% in time that is well separated from the inverting pulse.
%%
% The time until the inverse pulse determines when the echo will occur

%% MR Image Formation
% We now ask: How can we distinguish signals from different locations?  This 
% is the key step in learning how to form an image of the MR time constant's properties. 
% 
% Consider a simple situation in which we have two beakers sitting next to 
% one another on a table.  *Both contain water.  *Suppose the magnetic field is 
% uniform, and suppose that we measure T1.
%%
% We are going to need these variables to develop the story.  So, run these
% few lines before continuing.
Mo = 1;                 % Net magnetization
larmorFreq(1) = 12;     % Larmor frequency in MHz/10
larmorFreq(2) = 18;     % Larmor frequency in MHz/10
T1(1) = 1.5;
T1(2) = 3;
t = (0:.005:1)*(3*max(T1)); % Time samples in secs

% The function rfSignal produces the RF signal that we will measure given a
% particular time constant and Larmor frequency.
signal = rfSignal(T1(1),Mo,t,larmorFreq(1));

%% 
% The RF signal is periodic.  We can summarize the amplitude and frequency 
% of this signal by plotting the Fourier Transform amplitude spectrum.  This plot 
% measures the amplitude of each harmonic (temporal frequency) in the signal.
%%
subplot(1,2,2), cla
[s,f] = powerSpecDens(signal);
plot(f,s); grid on;
xlabel('Normalized frequency'); ylabel('Normalized power'); title('Slice selection')
%% 
% Next, consider the signal as the relaxation constant (tConstant) increases.  
% Notice that over the same period of time, the rfSignal has a larger amplitude 
% (there is less decay).
%%
clf;
tConstant = [1,2,4]; 
for ii=1:3

    signal = rfSignal(tConstant(ii),Mo,t,larmorFreq(1));
    plot(t,signal); hold on;
end
hold off
%% Question 2
% If you were to plot the Fourier Transform for each of the three subplots, 
% how do you expect they would differ?

% difference in the amplitude but not the peak frequency (?)
% the shape of the peak (wide vs. narrow)
%%
clf;

    signal = rfSignal(tConstant(ii),Mo,t,larmorFreq(1));
    plot(powerSpecDens(signal)); %powerSpecDens returns normalized frequency and power density
    % try psd(signal) instead
end

hold off
%% Changing the field strength
% Now, suppose that we change the magnetic field strength. Remember that the 
% Larmor frequency is proportional to the magnetic field. Consequently, the frequency 
% of the RF signal will increase. We can compare the signals at two different 
% frequencies as follows
%%
larmorFreq = [6, 124];
nFreqs = length(larmorFreq);

clf
for ii=1:nFreqs
    subplot(2,nFreqs,ii); set(gca,'ylim',[-1,1]);
    signal = rfSignal(T1(1),Mo,t,larmorFreq(ii));
    plot(t,signal)
end

% It is easiest to see the change in frequency if we compute the Fourier
% Transform of the two signals.
for ii=1:nFreqs
    subplot(2,nFreqs,ii+nFreqs); set(gca,'ylim',[0,25]);
    signal = rfSignal(T1(1),Mo,t,larmorFreq(ii));

%% 
% This figure is important.  It shows that the frequency of the response 
% from each beaker depends on the local magnetic field.  We have already seen 
% that the amplitude at the response frequency depends on the time constant.  
% We can take advantage of these two observations by introducing a gradient into 
% the magnetic field. 
% 
% By inserting a gradient, the two beakers experience slightly different 
% magnetic fields and thus the signals have two different Larmor frequencies. 
% The combined RF signal from the two beakers will be the sum of the signals from 
% the two beakers.

signal =  rfSignal(T1(1),Mo,t,larmorFreq(1)) + rfSignal(T1(1),Mo,t,larmorFreq(2));

%% 
% Finally, if the two beakers represent substances with different time constants, 
% we will be able to measure this by estimating the amplitudes of the two peaks 
% in the spectrum.  Here, we create a signal in which the two beakers are in a 
% gradient and the substances have slightly different time constants.

% associated with which beaker because their responses are at different

%% Question 3
% When computing the RF signal in the last example, which variable(s) represented 
% the magnetic field gradient?
% the peak frequency

% From answering Question 2, and understanding this simple case, you should 
% understand how the gradient associates different RF signal frequencies with 
% different spatial locations.
% 
% This is why determining the frequency amplitude of the signal, using the 
% Fourier Transform, is so important:  RF signal frequency is associated with 
% spatial position.  The amplitude at that frequency can be interpreted as the 
% decay rate. 
% 
% This simple example provides you with the basic principles of an important 
% MR imaging term: k-space. Specifically, in this example the frequency axis of 
% the Fourier Transform is analogous to k-space.
% 
% There are important limitations to the method we have developed up this 
% point.
% 
% Mainly, this method works if we only need to make images of an array of 
% beakers along a line. To make estimates of beakers spread across a table top 
% (2D) or filling up a box (3D) we need to do more.  These methods will be explained 
% below. 
% 
% The main difference between this example and general imaging is dimensionality. 
% In MR imaging the stimuli don't fall along one dimension, so we can't simply 
% use a one-dimensional frequency axis to assign position.  In general the position 
% in k-space corresponds to a position in a two-dimensional plane that represents 
% various spatial frequencies.
% 
% (By the way, there are historical reasons why they call it k-space.  Iforget 
% these reasons.  If someone can remind me, I will give them a firm handshake 
% and a warm smile.)
% 
% We will start to extend the ideas on imaging in this first section to slightly 
% more complex cases in the next section.
%% Slice position
% In nearly all fMRI imaging, the data are acquired using a series of measurements 
% from different planar sections (slices) of the tissue. The measurements are 
% made by selectively exciting the spins, one planar section at a time. If only 
% one plane is excited, then we can be confident that the signal we measure must 
% arise from a voxel in that plane. 
% 
% In the next part of this tutorial, we will reivew how we can excite the 
% spins in one planar section. Following that we will review how we can distinguish 
% different positions within the excited plane.
% 
% The principles used to understand slice selection are the same as the principles 
% used to distinguish signals from beakers at two positions. The main difference 
% is that in the previous example we used gradients to distinguish received signals. 
% In slice selection we use gradients to selectively deliver an excitation.
% 
% The idea is this. We introduce a magnetic field gradient across the sample 
% changing the Larmor frequency across the sample. When we deliver an RF pulse 
% at a particular frequency, then, only the spins in one portion of the gradient 
% field will be excited.
% 
% What would such a pulse look like? Let's create some examples.
%%
% We initialize the rfPulse to
% zero, and then we initialize some parameters.
nTime = 256;  t = (1:nTime)/nTime - 0.5;
rfPulse = zeros(1,nTime); 
pulseDuration = round(nTime/2);
pulseStart = nTime/2 - pulseDuration/2;
pulseStop = pulseStart + pulseDuration-1;
pulseT = t((pulseStart:pulseStop));

% We choose a pulse frequency.  This frequency will excite the planar
% section of the tissue that is at the Larmor frequency we wish to excite.
pulseFreq = 25;

% Now, create a sinusoid RF pulse at that frequency.
rfPulse(pulseStart:pulseStop) = sin(2*pi*pulseFreq*pulseT);
figure(1); clf;
subplot(1,2,1), plot(t,rfPulse); xlabel('Time'); ylabel('RF signal'); 
title('RF pulse'); grid on

% Here is the Fourier Transform spectrum of the RF pulse.
% The frequency content of the pulse determines which plane we excite.
subplot(1,2,2), 
[s,f] = powerSpecDens(rfPulse);
plot(f,s); grid on;
xlabel('Normalized frequency'); ylabel('Normalized power'); 
title('Slice selection')
%%
% We can control the position that is excited by adjusting the frequency.
pulseFreq = 50;
rfPulse(pulseStart:pulseStop) = sin(2*pi*pulseFreq*pulseT);
subplot(1,2,1), hold on, plot(t,rfPulse, 'r'); 
xlabel('Time'); ylabel('RF signal'); title('RF pulse')
subplot(1,2,2), hold on
[s,f] = powerSpecDens(rfPulse);
plot(f,s, 'r'); grid on;
xlabel('Normalized frequency'); ylabel('Normalized power'); 
title('Slice selection')
%% Slice width
% A second parameter we would like to control is the slice width.   There are 
% two ways we can adjust the slice width.  One way, as described in the book, 
% is to change the gradient.  A second way, illustrated here, is to change the 
% timing of the RF pulse.
% 
% In this example, we create an RF pulse that is the product of the sinusoid 
% and a sinc function.  (Type help sinc to read about this important function). 
% Each sinc function has its own frequency, too. 
%%
sincFreq  = 10;      % Try 10, 20 and 40.
pulseFreq = 25;      % Try 25, 50 and 75.

rfPulse(pulseStart:pulseStop) = sin(2*pi*pulseFreq*pulseT);
rfPulse(pulseStart:pulseStop) = ...
    rfPulse(pulseStart:pulseStop).*sincFunction(sincFreq*pulseT);

hold off;
subplot(1,2,1), plot(t,rfPulse,'r-');

hold off;
subplot(1,2,2), [s,f] = powerSpecDens(rfPulse); plot(f,s,'r--'); grid on; 
xlabel('Normalized frequency'); ylabel('Normalized power'); 
title('Slice selection')
%% Question 4
% Run the above code a few times, varying the pulse and sinc frequency  values.  
% What effect does each parameter have on slice position and slice width?

% sincFreq controls the slice width (larger sincFreq --> larger slice
% width)
% pulseFreq controls the slice position (higher pulseFreq --> further
% position
%% Frequency encoding and phase encoding together
% The Hornak MRI book, <http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/mri/ http://www.cis.rit.edu/htbooks/mri/>, 
% has a very good discussion of imaging, including frequency and phase encoding. 
% Please read Chapters 6 and 7 for a useful discussion of the principles further 
% described here. Also, the Huettel et al. book is very clear and useful in describing 
% pulse sequences (Chapters 4 and 5).
% 
% Earlier, we reviewed how to use a gradient field to associate different 
% positions along a line with different RF signal frequencies. That method is 
% often called frequency encoding. In this section, we describe how to measure 
% along the second spatial dimension. This measurement is sometimes called the 
% phase-encoding dimension. Taken together, the methods described in this section 
% are sometimes called Fourier Transform imaging.
% 
% Consider the problem of identifying signals from 4 beakers placed at the 
% corners of a square. These four beakers are in the planar section and the spins 
% were set in motion using the methods described in the previous section. 
% 
% First, we set up the basic parameters for the four beakers.

%% 
% Suppose we apply a gradient across the x-axis.  In the presence of this 
% gradient, the signals from the two beakers on the left will differ from  the 
% RF signals emitted by the two beakers on the right. When we measure with only 
% the x-gradient (Gx), we obtain the sum of the two beakers on the left in one 
% frequency band and the sum of the two beakers on the right in a second frequency 
% band.

title('Total RF Signal')
%% 
% Now, suppose that we turn off the Gx gradient and introduce a gradient 
% in the y-dimension (Gy).  This changes the Larmor frequency of the beakers at 
% the top and bottom of the square.  Suppose the frequency for the bottom beakers 
% is a little lower. Then the spins in the bottom beakers rotate more slowly and 
% they end up pointing in a different direction from the spins at the top.  After 
% applying Gy for a certain amount of time, the spins at the top and bottom will 
% point in opposite directions.

%% 
% Next, we switch off  Gy and turn on Gx.  As before we will measure the 
% combination of the spins on the left at one frequency and the combination of 
% the spins at the right at a different frequency.  Because the spins of the top 
% and bottom beaker oppose one another, however, the total RF signal we obtain 
% now is the difference between the top and bottom.

% These two measurements at the main frequencies provide an estimate of 
% the sum and the difference of the time constants in the upper and lower beakers. 
% Specifically, the two measurements are
% 
%       m1 = a + b;
% 
%       m2 = a - b;
% 
% Measuring m1 and m2, we can solve for a and b.
% 
% In this example, the frequency of the RF signal codes the x-dimension.  
% This dimension is called the frequency dimension.  We keep adjusting the  phase 
% of the spins along the y-dimension. Hence, this dimension is called the phase-encode 
% dimension.  People keep track of these two dimensions because the phase-encode 
% direction is subject to more measurement error than the frequency encode direction.
